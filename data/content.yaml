Profile: I am a motivated software tester with 8 months of experience in manual testing. I participated in the VK Testers program (social network), where I found bugs that were accepted for review.

I also had experience as a self-employed freelancer on the Yandex.Toloka platform. There, I performed a variety of monotonous tasks. However, I am eager to take on new challenges to grow and improve my IT skills further.
